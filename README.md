## Introduction
This repository was created as part of a learning exercise to practice and demonstrate Git and GitHub version control techniques. The tasks include initializing repositories, managing branches, resolving merge conflicts, and pushing changes to remote repositories.

---

## Project Goals
- Understand the basics of Git and GitHub.
- Learn how to use Git for version control in projects.
- Practice collaboration using branches and merging workflows.
- Resolve merge conflicts effectively.

## Tasks Completed

### Basic Git Operations
1. **Initialized the repository**: Created the `codecatalyst-learning` repository locally.
2. **Created and staged files**: Added `README.md` as a sample file and staged it using `git add`.
3. **Committed changes**: Committed the staged changes with meaningful messages.
4. **Pushed to GitHub**: Uploaded changes to the remote repository on GitHub.

### Branching and Collaboration
1. **Created a branch**: Created a new branch named `secondary-branch`.
2. **Switched branches**: Checked out to the `secondary-branch` to make changes independently.

### Merging Changes
1. **Merged branches**: Successfully merged `secondary-branch` with the main branch.
2. **Resolved merge conflicts**: Simulated a conflict, resolved it, and committed the changes.
